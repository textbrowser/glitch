Apple Silicon requires signed software and therefore a bundled
package will be considered tarnished. We recommend a Homebrew
solution. Please visit https://brew.sh and install Homebrew.

> brew install git
> brew install qt
> cd
> git clone https://github.com/textbrowser/glitch glitch.d
> cd glitch.d
> qmake
> make -j 5
> open ./Glitch.app
