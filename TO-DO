- Function redo / undo private container. The redo / undo stack must be
  separate of the function's parent view.
- Functions are defined on the main view. Allow multiple instances of
  a defined function. All duplicate instances should be duplicates of a single
  definition.

- Paste in child views. Redo / undo.
- Prepare Copy, Delete, Paste, and Select All states.

- Redo / undo shortcuts on edit windows.
- Redo / undo style sheets.
- Remove function clones.
- Remove function copies from diagram(s) on parent removal.

- Retain Tools Bar position.
- Retain loop(), setup () style sheets.
- Save As.
- Save button on tab.
- Save canvas settings.
- Save loop() and setup() style sheets.

- Select all.
- Separate database objects when opening an existing diagram.
- Separated window: context menu, generate source, save.
- Shortcuts in object views.
- Structures context menu on view object.
- Style sheets. User input is not validated.
- The name of the display in settings should be separate from the file name.
- Tools Bar?
- Unite separated windows.
- View separation.
- Warn of faulty home directory: read and write permissions.

- Warn on diagram overwrite during initialization.
- glitch_canvas_settings::settings(). Not needed.
- setWindowIcon(windowIcon()) on child dialogs.

Ignored Items

- Resize objects?
- The glitch_view parent must be passed to every child?

Remaining Items

- Adjust changed state of parent canvas if redo / undo stack of a child
  is at level zero. This is very difficult.
