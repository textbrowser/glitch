  primary mouse button should display the object's context menu.

  is at level zero. This is very difficult. Quite simple: review states of
  known redo/undo stacks.
- Alignment panel. The panel must allow interaction with separated windows.
  Per diagram.

- Copy Edit menu to child edit windows and separated windows.
  Redo / undo stack.
- Copy children!
- Copy wires? No, connections must be defined new.

- Delegate object constructors.
- Denote function return. See return flow control.
- Denote occupied objects (functions, loop(), setup(), etc).
- Depict changed pages. Window titles, etc.
- Depict cloned functions. Function definitions will contain labels having
  f symbols.
- Depict main functions via immutable themes.
- Detect scene boundaries and prevent placement outside of.
- Detect scene boundaries of object scenes.
- Display condition / label in flow control's edit window.
- Display main() function. Fixed position? Yes.
- Display tool mode in status bar.
- Do not align, stack, etc. unless coordinates would change.
- Do not clone pasted functions without parents unless they already exist.
- Do not delete function duplicates if one duplicate is removed.
- Do not discover parent functions for copied functions.
- Dots and grids.
- Dragging an item onto a diagram and scroll bars.
- Draw input and output connectors.
- Edit window icons.
- Error dialog.
- Exiting does not require closing of pages.
- Flow-control objects and edit views (break does not have a view).
- Full-screen and normal-screen modes.
- Function clones should have redo / undo stack of parent function.
- Function names and deleted functions; uniqueness errors.
- Function redo / undo private container. The redo / undo stack must be
  separate of the function's parent view.
- Functions are defined on the main view. Allow multiple instances of
  a defined function. All duplicate instances should be duplicates of a single
  definition.
- Generate periodically.
- Group delete.
- Identifiers are incorrect for function children.
- Inspect coordinates upon opening of diagrams. Adjust.
- Intelligent beginMacro() / endMacro().
- Intelligent select mode: select or wire by proximity.
- Limit SQL text retrieval via SUBSTR().
- List of recent files.
- Movement via arrows. Increase distance if Shift is depressed.
- Object numbers should be sequenced.
- Order items by bubbles and coordinates. Orders describe order in
  generated source.
- Other constants.
- Pass undo stack from top-level view to child views.
- Paste in child views. Redo / undo.
- Periodically-generated source and redo / undo.
- Prepare Copy, Delete, Paste, and Select All states.
- Prepare parents after cloning objects.
- Prepare settings of child views on initialization.
- Raise currently-selected function via z-value. This will allow the function's
  combination box to float above other widgets.
- Recreating functions and unique names.
- Redo / undo function names.
- Redo / undo lock positions.
- Redo / undo shortcuts on edit windows.
- Redo / undo style sheets.
- Remove function clones.
- Remove function copies from diagram(s) on parent removal.
- Remove functions from User Functions on redo / undo.
- Remove missing diagram files.
- Reparent support panels if a canvas is separated. Not necessary. Append
  Qt::Dialog to separated window's window flags. Not standard.
- Reset object order on delete / redo / undo.
- Retain Tools Bar position.
- Retain loop(), setup () style sheets.
- Review lengthy tool tips.
- Save As.
- Save button on tab.
- Save canvas settings.
- Save loop() and setup() style sheets.
- Save position-locked property.
- Save, Save As on separated windows.
- Select all.
- Selection rectangle moves wired objects. Ignore wires.
- Separate database objects when opening an existing diagram.
- Separated window: context menu, generate source, save.
- Shortcuts in object views.
- Split properties via special regular expression.
- Structures context menu on view object.
- Style sheets. User input is not validated.
- The name of the display in settings should be separate from the file name.
- Tools Bar?
- Undo macros for group actions.
- Unite separated windows.
- Variable clones. Not necessary.
- View separation.
- Warn of faulty home directory: read and write permissions.
- Warn of missing SQLite driver.
- Warn on diagram overwrite during initialization.
- Wire color setting.
- Wire is not intially drawn if objects are connected at a great distance.
  Set initial bounding rectangle.
- Wire redo / undo.
- Wiring.
- Wiring beyond the scene. Issue prepareGeometryChange() before preparing
  the bounding rectangle. Not necessary. Approximate the bounding rectangle.
- glitch_canvas_settings::settings(). Not needed.
- prepareGeometryChange() may decrease performance. Implement shape().
- setWindowIcon(windowIcon()) on child dialogs.
