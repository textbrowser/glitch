  known redo / undo stacks.

- Function redo / undo private container. The redo / undo stack must be
  separate of the function's parent view.

  a defined function. All duplicate instances should be duplicates of a single
  definition.

  generated source.
- Other constants.
- Page shortcut (Alt-1, etc.).
- Pass undo stack from top-level view to child views.
